    <h1>About Us</h1>    
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Helping you and your friends store and share your favorite recipes! We know how hard it is to: 
        <ul>
            <li>Find recipes that fit your dietary needs</li>
            <li>Store recipes in a way that lets you avoid ads in the future</li>
            <li>Share your creation with friends and family without getting sucked into Instagram or Facebook</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p> So we created "Dara's Recipe Book" to help everyone store and share their recipes!</p>
