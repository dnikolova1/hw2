        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl underline">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Helping you and your friends store and share your favorite recipes! We know how hard it is to: 
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-1 pr-4 pl-4">
                <li>Find recipes that fit your dietary needs</li>
                <li>Store recipes in a way that lets you avoid ads in the future</li>
                <li>Share your creation with friends and family without getting sucked into Instagram or Facebook</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p> So we created "Dara's Recipe Book" to help everyone store and share their recipes!</p>
